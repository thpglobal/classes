# classes

* This is the set of classes currently in thpclasses (as of 12/2022) but converted into a Composer Package
* To use it, you just do 
```
composer require thpglobal/classes
```
* This will load the classes inside vendor, using the namespace thpglobal/classes
* With luck, this will create an entire app with just two includes - thpsecurity and menu
